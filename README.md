This repo contains the Witcher Memory Match application. Designed for mobile and desktop, memory match is a game with 18 cards face down and the player has to match all 9 pairs of cards. Once the player has matched 2 cards, the pair will remain faced up. Once all pairs have been matched the user will receive a message informing they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards stats will be kept, informing the user of their attempts, games played, and current accuracy.
